### Installation

Follow these steps to install and start the app:
* Install docker CE, NPM, node, nodejs and yarn. (all by the official websites)
* Run this command to create a docker container with postgres:
```
docker run --name database  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=minasbike -p 5433:5432 -d postgres:11
```
OBS: the container will point the database to the port 5433 of your machine.


### Start the app

On the app directory, run this commands:
*To install all dependencies and setup database:
```
yarn
yarn sequelize db:drop
yarn sequelize db:create
yarn sequelize db:migrate
```

```
yarn dev
```
